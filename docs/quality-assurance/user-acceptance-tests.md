# User Acceptance Tests (UAT)

Our project regularly undergoes User Acceptance Testing to ensure that it meets stakeholder expectations.

## UAT Procedure

1. Define test scenarios based on user stories (available via the link: https://github.com/users/ProjectSWD12/projects/1).
2. Involve actual users (tour guides, admins).
3. Perform tests on staging or production environments.
4. Collect and document feedback.
